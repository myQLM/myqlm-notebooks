        "In reversible computation in general, and quantum computation in particular, there is a need for careful usage of temporary memory. This leads to particularly intricated code design where the programmer needs to keep track of the current state of the temporary memory in order to efficiently reuse previously allocated bits.\n",

        "\n",
        "The idea is to tag some wires of a `QRoutine` as ancillae. Tagging a wire can be seen as a \"contract\" between the routine and the outer-scope saying : \"Give me a fresh qubit in state $|0\\rangle$, and I promise that I'll give it back to you in state $|0\\rangle$\".\n",

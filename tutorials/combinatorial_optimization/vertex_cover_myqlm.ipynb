    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an undirected graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to find the smallest number of nodes to be coloured, such that every edge has a coloured vertex. Also, which vertices would these be? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vertex Cover has applications in matching problems and optimization problems in fields like Biochemistry, Computational Biology, Monitoring and Computer Network Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to solving the problem\n",
    "Vertex Cover is a minimization problem and its cost function can be cast to a QUBO problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)),\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\displaystyle \\large\n",
    "H = A \\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{uv \\in E}  (1 - x_u) (1 - x_v) + B \\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{v} x_v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants, $u, v \\in V$ and $x_u$ is a binary variable, which is $1$ if vertex $u$ is part of the Vertex Cover and $0$ if it is not. For a valid encoding, the $A$ and $B$ constants need to obey the relation $A > B$. \n",
    "Otherwise, if this rule is not followed, the spin configuration for the lowest energy $H$ may not correspond to the best solution of our Vertex Cover problem or even to a valid one. At the same time $A \\gg B$ would not be desired, as it would cause a large energy separation in $H$, impeding our solution approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form by using the `VertexCover` class for a given graph and constants $A$ and $B$. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the solution to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the problem as QUBO, myQLM would need $N$ spins $-$ to encode each of the $N$ vertices. "

        "An instrinsic feature of all NP problems is that they can be formulated as minimization or maximization problems, i.e. with a cost function. At the same time finding the lowest energy of a physical system, represented by a cost Hamiltonian, is also a minimization problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to this intimate relation, we can represent the cost function of an NP problem by a cost Hamiltonian. Such a Hamiltonian $H$, either in an Ising or QUBO form (see below) has two important properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We can encode the solution of our problem in its ground state (which is the one of minimum energy).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. We can bring $H$ to this minimum energy by a heuristic Simulated Annealer (SA).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where the myQLM comes in $-$ it is equipped with tools for performing SA on whatever Hamiltonian, provided it is formulated as Ising or QUBO. Hence, each of the NP problems can be solved in this way."

For any given problem, our aim is to pick $h$ and $J$ such that only one particular combination of spin values $(s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n)$ will make $H$ lowest.

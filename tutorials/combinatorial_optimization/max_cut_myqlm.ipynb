    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an undirected graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to partition the graph into two subgraphs connected by the maximum number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxCut is a ubiquitous problem in fields like Network Design, Statistical Physics, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), Circuit Layout Design, Data Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to solving the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "MaxCut is a maximization problem and its cost function can be cast to an Ising problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut#Theoretical_physics)),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\displaystyle \\large\n",
    "H = \\displaystyle \\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{uv \\in E} s_{u} s_{v}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v, u \\in V$ and $s_u$ is a spin variable, which is $1$ if vertex $u$ is in the one subgraph and $-1$ if it is in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form by using the `MaxCut` class with some specified graph. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the best solution to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum resources\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the problem as Ising, myQLM would need $N$ spins (one spin per vertex). "

    "Imagine we are given a tree graph with $30$ vertices and $29$ edges, as shown below (left). One may quickly figure that we can partition the graph into two subgraphs, connected by all the graph edges. To achieve this, we can simply colour the nodes on the even levels of the tree graph by one colour, and the nodes on the odd levels $-$ by the other (right).\n",

    "# Number Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a set of $N$ real and potentially repeating numbers and our aim is to partition them in two subsets, such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal (or as close as possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Number Partitioning problem comes up in a variety of fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fair division of assets between two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Statistical Mechanics to count the available states to many-particle systems and for calculation of the Partition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partitioning irreducible representations of important groups like the permutation group $S(n)$ and the Unitary Group $U(n)$, which themselves have applications in Molecular Chemistry, Crystalography and Quantum Mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computing many-variable integrals, representing wave functions of many-body systems and in Statistical Theory of Random Matrices that is used to model complex networks, disordered media and chaotic quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public key encryption and task scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to solving the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Number Partitioning can be formulated as a minimization problem and its cost function can be cast to an Ising problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\displaystyle \\large\n",
    "H = \\displaystyle \\left(\\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} n_i s_i \\right) ^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_i$ is the $i$-th number from the list of numbers and $s_i$ is a spin variable, indicating which subset $n_i$ belongs to. If $s_i = 1$, it is in one subset and if $s_i = -1$, it is in the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form with the help of the `NumberPartitioning` class and by providing a list of numbers. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the solution to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum resources\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the problem as Ising, myQLM would need $N$ spins, one for each number in the list. "

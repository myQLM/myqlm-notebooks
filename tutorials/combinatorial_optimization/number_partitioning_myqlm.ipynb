        "- Fair division of assets between two parties.\n",

        "- In Statistical Mechanics to count the available states to many-particle systems and for calculation of the Partition function.\n",

        "- Partitioning irreducible representations of important groups like the permutation group $S(n)$ and the Unitary Group $U(n)$, which themselves have applications in Molecular Chemistry, Crystalography and Quantum Mechanics.\n",

        "Number Partitioning can be formulated as a minimization problem and its cost function can be cast to an Ising problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)),\n",

        "\n",
        "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form with the help of the `NumberPartitioning` class and by providing a list of numbers. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the solution to our problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",

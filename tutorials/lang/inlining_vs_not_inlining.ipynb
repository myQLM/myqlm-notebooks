    "## Structure of the Circuit object\n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits generated by pyAQASM have a particular structure that allows to store efficiently the instruction flow resulting from its execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits are composed of a main body: the `.ops` field. It consists in a simple list of operations. Operations can be any of basic instructions supported by (py)AQASM (i.e measure, reset, quantum gate, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum gates used inside this main body (or anywhere else inside the circuit) are references to an entry of a gate dictionary stored in the `.gateDic` field of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be space and informationally efficient, a gate can be defined in several different fashions (not exclusive):\n",
    " - via a matrix : this is the case of all the basic gates\n",
    " - via some syntax (i.e name + list of parameters): this is also the case for all the basic gates, but also any `AbstractGate`\n",
    " - via some circuit implementation: this is the case for any `AbstractGate` that has a `circuit_generator`\n",
    " \n",
    "The former being the equivalent of a function call: a gate can be seen as a function applying a fixed circuit (or stream of instructions) on a list of arguments, the arguments being the qubits.\n",
    "In particular, storing each recurrent subcircuit inside an `AbstractGate` will factorise a large portion of the circuit into a single gate definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inlining\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating a circuit using pyAQASM, you can ask the `to_circ` method to go down into each gate definition and inline the circuit implementation of the gate inside the main body of the circuit. This process is costly, and is deactivated by default (argument `inline`, see the documentation of `to_circ`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all the simulators in the QLM (and myQLM) support the emulation of the frame stack during the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to unify the way the stack is managed, the `Circuit` structure itself has a built-in iterator emulating the execution flow generated by this stack emulation."

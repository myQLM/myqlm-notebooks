    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an undirected graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to find out whether there exists a complete subgraph of size $K$ in this graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Clique problem is important in areas like Bioinformatics, Computational Chemistry, Motion Segmentation and for finding structures in a graph. For example, anomalously large cliques in a network may be a sign that the underlying node connectivity is not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to solving the problem\n",
    "K-Clique can be formulated as a maximization problem and its cost function can be cast to a QUBO problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\displaystyle \\large\n",
    "H = A \\displaystyle \\left( K - \\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{v} x_v \\right) ^2 + B \\left[ \\frac{K(K-1)}{2} - \\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{uv \\in E}  x_u x_v \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants, $v, u \\in V$ and $x_v$ is a binary variable, which is $1$ if vertex $v$ is part of the clique and $0$ if it is not. For a valid encoding, the constants $A$ and $B$ need to obey the relation $$A > B * K$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if the rule is not followed, the spin configuration for the lowest energy $H$ may not correspond to the best solution of our K-Clique problem or even to a valid one. At the same time, it should not be overspecified, i.e. the left side being much bigger than the right side. If  $A$ is much larger, this would cause a large energy separation in $H$, impeding our solution approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form by using the `KClique` class for a given graph, clique size $K$ and constants $A$ and $B$. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the solution to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum resources\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the problem as QUBO the QLM would need $N$ spins $-$ one for each of the $N$ vertices. "

For this problem, the solution is straightforward $-$ one can notice that nodes $0$, $1$ and either $2$ or $5$ constitute such a complete graph (right).\n",

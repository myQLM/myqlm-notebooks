        "\n",
        "A plugin is a tool which can be link to a QPU to make the computation stack more powerful. A plugin is used to pre-process batches sended to a QPU and/or post-process results of a QPU.\n",
        "When a Plugin is linked to a QPU, a new QPU is created. For instance, the following code defines a new QPU where each batch sended to this object is pre-processed and each result is post-processed by the plugin \"*Plugin()*\":\n",

        "The QLM provides classes to define your own plugin, an example of custom plugin is presented in [**this tutorial**](plugins.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, some plugins are already implemented in the QLM:\n",
        " - [**Quameleon plugin**](./emulating_custom_hardware_specs.ipynb): this plugin is used to simulate hardware specs for any QPU\n",
        " - the [**observable splitter plugin**](./observable_splitter.ipynb) can be used to tranform observable sampling into computational basis sampling\n",
        " - the [**circuit inliner**](./circuit_inliner.ipynb) can be used to inline the content of a circuit in its main (in case some other Plugin needs to access the inlined circuit)\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, [**this**](./plugins.ipynb) notebook shows how to write your own QLM compatible plugin."

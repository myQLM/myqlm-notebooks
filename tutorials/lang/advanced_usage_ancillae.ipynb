    "# Temporary/ancilla qubits management\n",
    "\n",
    "In reversible computation in general, and quantum computation in particular, there is a need for careful usage of temporary memory. This leads to particularly intricated code design where the programmer needs to keep track of the current state of the temporary memory in order to efficiently reuse previously allocated bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyAQASM`'s `QRoutine`s come with a built-in structure that allows the programmer to partially unload this complexity and postpone the ancilla allocation to the circuit extraction stage (the `to_circ` method of the `Program` class).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to tag some wires of a `QRoutine` as ancillae. Tagging a wire can be seen as a \"contract\" between the routine and the outer-scope saying : \"Give me a fresh qubit in state $|0\\rangle$, and I promise that I'll give it back to you in state $|0\\rangle$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the circuit extraction routine to manage the temporary qubits on its own. The user will not have to allocate these additional qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define a simple routine that uses an ancilla to perform a `RZ` on a 2-qubit state if and only if the `and` of the two qubits is true (basically a controled `RZ` with a twist).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us define a routine that do this the naive way:"

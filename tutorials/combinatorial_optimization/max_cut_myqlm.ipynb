        "MaxCut is a maximization problem and its cost function can be cast to an Ising problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut#Theoretical_physics)),\n",

        "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form by using the `MaxCut` class with some specified graph. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the best solution to our problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",

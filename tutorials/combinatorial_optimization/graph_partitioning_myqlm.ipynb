    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an undirected graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to partition the graph into two equally-sized subgraphs connected by the minimal number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Partitioning problem comes up in computations on graphs. One can parallelise these computations by performing them on subgraphs of the original graph and then concatenate the final solutions with minimal adjustments. The problem also has applications in biological, social and transportation networks, Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), Image Processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Path to solving the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Partitioning is a minimization problem and its cost function can be cast to an Ising problem through its respective Hamiltonian (see the [Introduction](./introduction_combinatorial_optimization_myqlm.ipynb) and a [reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5843)),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\displaystyle \\large\n",
    "H = A \\displaystyle \\left(\\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} s_{i} \\right) ^2 + B\\textstyle\\sum\\limits_{uv \\in E} \\frac{1 - s_u s_v}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ and $B$ are positive constants, $v, u \\in V$, $N$ is the number of vertices and $s_i$ is a spin variable, which is $1$ if vertex $i$ is in the one partition and $-1$ if it is in the other. For a valid encoding, the constants $A$ and $B$ need to obey the relation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{A}{B} \\geq \\frac{\\min(2\\Delta, N)}{8}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph. Otherwise, if the rule is not followed, the spin configuration for the lowest energy $H$ may not correspond to the best solution of our Graph Partitioning problem or even to a valid one. At the same time, it should not be overspecified either, i.e. the left side being much bigger than the right side. If the ratio $\\frac{A}{B}$ is too large, this would cause a large energy separation in $H$, impeding our solution approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The myQLM allows us to encode a problem in this Hamiltonian form by using the `GraphPartitioning` class. This class should be provided with a graph, as well as the $A$ and $B$ constants. We can then create a job from the problem and send it to a Simulated Annealer (SA) wrapped with a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) interface. The SA will minimize the Hamiltonian, hence we find the solution to our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the QLM contains an even more powerful solver $-$ Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA). This quantum annealer has been tested on numerous benchmarks for the NP problems supported and produces results with a quality usually exceeding $98\\%$. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://myqlm.github.io/advanced_combinatorial_optimization.html#simulated-quantum-annealing-benchmarking-and-performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum resources\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the problem as Ising, myQLM would need $N$ spins (one for each vertex)."
